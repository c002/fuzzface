1. Recompute IP Checksum
2. Recompute TCP Checksum
3. Recompute UDP Checksum
4. Convert IPv4 packets to IPv6 (randomly?)
5. Add the ability to inject 802.1q or MPLS headers
6. Start adding smart fuzzing stack:
   a) ethernet
   b) ipv4
   c) tcp
   d) udp
7. Support big endian files
8. Unit tests
9. Allow for infinitely looping over a directory
10. Make code exception safe :x
11. --help command
12. --version would probably be good too.
12. A better usage statement. Switch over to boost's options?
13. Statistics (bytes, packets, files, loops(?), etc)
14. Support windows? :(
15. More OO approach. All logic in main is hard to unit test :x
16. Configure / make / make install? Not sure if this will be used that way.
17. Better makefile. Completely hacked right now.
18. Support other capture file formats
