1. Recompute IP Checksum
2. Recompute TCP Checksum
3. Recompute UDP Checksum
4. Convert IPv4 packets to IPv6 (randomly?)
5. Add the ability to inject 802.1q or MPLS headers
6. Start adding smart fuzzing stack:
   a) ethernet
   b) ipv4
   c) tcp
   d) udp
7. Support big endian files
8. Unit tests
9. Allow for infinitely looping over a directory
10. try / catch clean up. If I was more specific on catches I could combine a few of these
11. --help command
12. --version would probably be good too.
13. Switch over to boost's program options for command line params
14. Support windows? :(
15. Configure / make / make install? Not sure if this will be used that way.
16. Better makefile. Completely hacked right now.
17. Support other capture file formats
18. Allow users to simply write out the file? Might nix this. Netcat will do this.
